Introduction:
The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the way businesses operate, and chatbots have emerged as a key technology driving this transformation. This literature review synthesizes the findings of three research papers focused on the role and significance of chatbots in businesses, exploring their benefits, types, and applications in various sectors.

The Significance of AI-Powered Chatbots:

These benefits have significant implications for businesses, enabling them to improve customer interactions, reduce costs, and enhance overall performance.

Chatbots in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs):
The second paper explores the adoption of chatbots by SMEs to enhance customer service and business performance. The study identifies key features and elements that fit SMEs' characteristics and customer interactions with chatbots. The findings suggest that chatbots can be a valuable tool for SMEs, enabling them to compete with larger enterprises and improve their bottom line.
